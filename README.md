# Gryphondor Wordpress theme
## Timeline
The theme is only currently a group of html/css files that will eventually be ported into Wordpress. Because the theme is so massive, this seems to be the easiest way to go about making it. Here's the plan:

* HTML scaffolding for front page [complete]
* Add in CSS and images
* Work with the responsive-ness of the site (and make it work)
* Convert it into a Wordpress theme (on a new branch)
* Eternal glory

## License

* jQuery and Modernizer have their own licenses (MIT/GPL and MIT/BSD respectively)
* Bootstrap and the HTML 5 Boilerplate are public domain
* All modifications (and story snippets) are property of the Daily Bruin. You may use the source code as a reference or view within a debugger, but may not modify the code or use it to create derivative works. (This license will probably change soon so if you'd like a different license send us an email at __online@media.ucla.edu__.)
