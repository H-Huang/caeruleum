## Notes and todo
The icons included in the theme are from the [Social Media Bookmark Icon Set](http://www.nouveller.com/general/free-social-media-bookmark-icon-pack-the-ever-growing-icon-set/), but those icons are outdated and do not necessarily fit our needs. (The twitter icon, for example, is their old logo.) This icon set will be replaced towards the release of this theme or on a second release.
