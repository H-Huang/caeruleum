<h2>Long Story Short</h2>
<h3>Monday, 6-6:30 p.m.</h3>
<p>Live from the hills of Westwood, the Daily Bruin presents its award-winning weekly news and culture talk show, Long Story Short. The show began airing in the winter of 2011 as a pre-recorded podcast with one broadcast host and single segment stories, eventually evolving into a live show broadcast from the UCLA Radio studio. The show covers all walks of life at UCLA, from science and health to arts and politics to local news and campus buzz. Long Story Short aims to focus on members of the UCLA community and their projects, personalities and perspectives.</p>

<h2>Out of Bounds</h2>
<h3>Monday, 6:30-7 p.m.</h3>
<p> For an in-depth look at the UCLA sports scene, tune into Out of Bounds, the Daily Bruin’s weekly sports talk show. The latest and greatest of UCLA Athletics are presented with the show’s famous “Westwood Week in Review,” clips from UCLA coaches and athletes, and a high-stakes prediction segment called “You Better Be Right,” where failure to pick the winning team of the week may result in Taylor Swift showdowns and changing twitter pictures to the hosts’ worst nightmares. </p>
