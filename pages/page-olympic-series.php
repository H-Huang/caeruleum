				    <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he University of California has a listening problem. </p>
				    <p>Last summer, the opportunity to commit UC apparel licensees to more stringent labor codes arose. Instead of doing so, policymakers made a commitment of passive leniency. And what's worse, individual UCs seem barred from disagreement. </p><p>The rise and fall of these ethical standards began with a historic controversy with JanSport &#8211; one of UCLA's main licensees.</p>
					<p>In April 2013 there was a disastrous <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/world/asia/bangladesh-building-collapse.html?_r=2">building collapse</a> in Dhaka, Bangladesh. More than 1,000 people died and more than 2,000 were injured. The Rana Plaza building housed several factories.</p>

				    <p class="first-paragraph"><b></b><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen it comes to consumerism, the ethical standards of UCLA may be higher than those of its own students. <br /></p><p><b></b>In the past two weeks I have written columns exploring UCLA's licensing agreements and the labor violations behind these licensed apparel companies. The garment industry has a rampant history of worker rights infringements &#8211; incidents that still persist today. In past years, UCLA has continuously worked with these companies to hold them to higher moral standards and labor codes.</p>
					<p>The difficulty is that the university relies on energy from student campaigns to enforce these ethical commitments.
					 Student indifference restricts the school's negotiating power.</p>
