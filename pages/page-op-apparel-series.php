				    <p>The University of California has a listening problem.</p>
					
					<p>Last summer, the opportunity to commit UC apparel licensees to more stringent labor codes arose. 
						Instead of doing so, policymakers made a commitment of passive leniency. And what’s worse, 
						individual UCs seem barred from disagreement.</p>
					
					<p>The rise and fall of these ethical standards began with a historic controversy with JanSport – 
						one of UCLA’s main licensees.</p>

					<p>In April 2013 there was a disastrous building collapse in Dhaka, Bangladesh. More than 1,000 people
					 died and more than 2,000 were injured. The Rana Plaza building housed several factories, some of which 
					 produced apparel for VF Corporation, the parent company of JanSport.</p>

					<p>The collapse spurred the creation of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh. The Accord 
					is a legally binding agreement between brands and trade unions to ensure worker safety, disclose factory 
					locations, allow independent inspections and commit to remediation. The Accord is signed by over 200 brands,
					retailers from over 20 countries, two global trade unions, eight Bangladesh trade unions and four nongovernmental
					organization witnesses. It is also endorsed by the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) and United Students Against 
					Sweatshops (USAS).</p>

					<p>VF Corporation refused to sign the Accord and responded by joining the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.</p>

					<p>VF Corporation is a founding and funding member of the Alliance. Even more dubious is that the Alliance is neither
					 legally binding nor obligates signatories to financial remediation. The Alliance has also had differing factory 
					 inspection results compared to the Accord.</p>

					 <a href="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/01/map.png"><img clas="demo-image" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/01/map.png"/></a>

					<p>During all this time the UC system was monitoring the developments.</p>

					<p>The UC Code of Conduct for Trademark Licensees Steering Committee listened to representatives from both the Accord
					 and the Alliance. After a year of investigation, the committee unanimously voted for all UCs to adopt the Accord. 
					 But in June, University of California President Janet Napolitano decided differently.</p>

					<p>The Alliance is an embarrassingly poor imitation of the Accord. Licensing companies that are part of the Alliance
					 is an affront to the honest efforts of Accord members and an affront to the moral standards of the UC system. 
					 The UCs need to be committed to the Accord alone.</p>

					<p>The decision by the UC president came as a surprise and disappointment.</p>

					<p>“Just like that, the unanimous opinion of the committee was reversed,” says Richard Appelbaum, a UC Santa Barbara 
						faculty member of the UC Code of Conduct Steering Committee.</p>

					<p>The reversal was supposedly justified by stating that both the Alliance and Accord have seen progress since inception.
					 But more obviously, the tangible evidence and data from a devoted committee’s work was seemingly overturned by 
					 vacuous pleas.</p>

					<p>“The head of the Alliance sent a letter to the [UC] president where it says not to believe the allegations made
					 by the WRC and USAS,” said Appelbaum.</p>

					<p class="quote">The UC president also received a letter from the CEO of VF Corporation stating the company has been “wrongly and 
						unfairly targeted by USAS” and that “we consistently place worker safety as a high priority in every factory.”</p>

					<p>Unanimity – difficult to achieve on any issue – reflects the seriousness of VF Corporation’s violations. But the break
					 from this recommendation gives doubt as to how loudly these ethical concerns are heard in the first place, not to 
					 mention a conflict of interests.</p>

					<p>But the story doesn’t end there. When UCSB tried to hold its licensees to only the Accord, it was barred from doing so.</p>

					<p>During the summer of 2015, the UCSB chapter of USAS urged the school to pull JanSport products from its bookstore. 
						After the announcement from the UCOP, Appelbaum and USAS then led an initiative for UCSB to comply solely with 
						the Accord – breaking the UC-wide policy.</p>

					<p>“The students and board supported it unanimously and we thought it would be OK to hold UCSB [and licensees] to a 
						higher standard,” said Appelbaum. “But the UC legal office ruling said that the decision 
						[by the UC president for the UCs] was binding.”</p>

					<p>The message was clear: no single UC should break from the UC-wide policy on trademark licensing.</p>

					<p>Other U.S. universities responded much earlier and more definitively to infringements by VF Corporation.</p>

					<p>NYU put all new orders with JanSport on hold in May 2014. Cornell cut ties with JanSport in October 2014. 
						By February 2015, 16 U.S. universities had cut ties with JanSport, and by November 2015, 22 universities had cut 
						ties with VF Corporation. JanSport remains licensed through UCLA.</p>

					<p>JanSport’s negligence concerning worker safety in Bangladesh will most likely continue. VF Corporation 
						continues to ignore demands and would rather face financial losses from the college market than acknowledge
						 accountability.</p>

					<p>The political, economic and ethical interests overlap greatly in these issues. I do not pretend that I am 
						knowledgeable enough to confidently recommend whether it is more within the University’s interests to cut
						 ties or negotiate with JanSport.</p>

					<p>But an immediate action is clear: UC licensees should be required to adhere to the Accord.</p>

					<p>The announcement requiring UCs to adopt either the Accord or the Alliance was a mistake, and it diminished 
						the UC Code of Conduct Steering Committee’s entire year of work. It is hard enough to investigate and 
						substantiate the histories of apparel companies, but those efforts become worthless and despairing 
						if policymakers do not even listen to these findings.</p>

					<p>Labor rights abuses in the garment industry are living and widespread. Change amidst large apparel companies
					 is slow and incremental because we are fighting economic incentive. And change becomes harder to realize the
					  more we grow complicit and impassive. The opportunity to preferentially adopt the Accord among the UCs was a rare 
					  chance, but through rare chances come the beginning of change. Last year, we lost this chance.</p>

					<p>Drop the Alliance and perhaps we can redeem that chance.</p>

				  <h3 class="part2"> UCLA Athletics must examine brand accountability in apparel deals </h1>

				    <p>UCLA Athletics has a huge decision to make. And it has nothing to do with athletes.</p>

					<p>In 2017, the licensing contract between Adidas and UCLA Athletics is set to be renewed or terminated.</p>

					<p>Inevitably, speculations will begin to circulate as to whether UCLA will continue its relationship with Adidas
					 or switch to another competing brand. Perhaps we will license Nike and follow in the footsteps of other Pac-12 members.
					  Or maybe, if unexpectedly, Under Armour.</p>

					<p>But beneath all of these brands lies the sordid not-so-secret secret of the garment industry: a torrent of labor
					 rights abuses, worker safety violations and infringements on worker freedoms.</p>

					<p>This is a widely known reality. And yet it has lost its urgency. UCLA Athletics has a duty to recall the breadth
					 of the violations beneath Adidas – or any major brand it licenses. Athletics should consider a split from Adidas
					  entirely and a jump to Under Armour. If this is impossible, then a renewed contract with Adidas must come with
					   additional bargaining that assesses improved labor conditions over time.</p>

					<p>There are few other legitimate alternatives for universities with competitive sports teams. Few, if any, companies
					 are equipped to provide the need for custom uniforms, equipment, mass orders and delivery to schools as large as UCLA.</p>

					<p>Which means that economics has become tangled with politics and ethics. So there is a very precarious balance between
					 pushing apparel companies to meet better standards while still maintaining a safe business.</p>

					<p>But it’s evident that the imbalance has shifted too far toward the employer. To start, let’s look
					 at Adidas’ recent history.</p>

					<p>In late 2010, labor rights violations began to worsen at the PT Kizone factory in Indonesia. In April 2011,
					 the owner fled and the factory closed without paying an estimated $1.8 million in severance pay to 2,800 workers.
					  Adidas reportedly produced through PT Kizone throughout this time.</p>

					<p>The incident was assessed by the Worker Rights Consortium – the major independent monitoring organization that
					 investigates and reports on labor rights at factories producing for global collegiate apparel brands. Adidas
					  refused to financially contribute a cent of due severance. Nike paid $500,000.</p>

					<p>Then, things got awkward for Adidas in 2012 when a number of new violations came to light.</p>

					<p>In April, near the London Olympic Games, allegations flew that the Great Britain team uniforms manufactured by
					 Adidas came from sweatshops.</p>

					<p>In July, four more incidents erupted in the media.</p>

					<p>More than a thousand workers were fired after going on strike at the PT Panarub Industry factory in Indonesia.
					 The company was the main global manufacturer of Adidas soccer cleats.</p>

					<p>More than a hundred workers contracted occupational diseases from unsafe working conditions at Dynamica Casting
					 in Guangzhou, China. The company produced golf clubs for Adidas’ TaylorMade Golf Company.</p>

					<p>Workers suffering from occupational benzene poisoning demanded medical attention and compensation at the Xingang
					 Shoe Company in Dongguan, China. Benzene is a carcinogen found in glues used for shoe manufacturing. This company
					  produced footwear for Adidas.</p>

					<p>Simultaneous protests also took place in four Central American countries and Caribbean islands over labor rights
					 violations toward Gildan Activewear. Gildan Activewear was Adidas and Nike’s biggest supplier in the
					  Western Hemisphere.</p>

					<p>By then some U.S. universities began to question their relationship with Adidas. Cornell University cut ties completely.</p>

					<p>And during this time, United Students Against Sweatshops was conducting a “Badidas” campaign to force Adidas
					 to compensate the workers of PT Kizone. Amid international pressure, the campaign ended in victory.</p>

					<p>Adidas has a fresh history of failing to defend its workers overseas. These workers are not guaranteed a
					 living wage, safe working conditions, the right to organize or bargain nor due severance or compensation.</p>

					<p>So would Nike be the lesser of the two evils? Think again.</p>

					<p>Nike has a notorious sweatshop image that stretches back to the 1990s. I will not go into detail here about
					 its history because UCLA Athletics does not license Nike. But take it as an assertion that Nike seems no better
					  than Adidas. Issues of low wages, forced over-time and verbal and physical abuse return throughout the years.
					   USAS ran a successful campaign against Nike in 2010 for failing to pay severance to workers in Honduras.</p>

					<p>The only claim that Nike could possibly make over Adidas is greater transparency. In the past decade Nike
					 has disclosed its overseas factories, acknowledged issues with labor safety and worked with organizations like
					  the WRC to improve worker conditions.</p>

					<p>That is, until now.</p>

					<p>In November, Nike informed the WRC that it will no longer allow them to independently monitor their factories
					 that produce collegiate apparel. This was reaffirmed in December  when Nike communicated to universities that
					  the WRC was not allowed to access or assess their supplier factories. Only organizations approved by Nike itself,
					   such as the Fair Labor Association, are entitled to such privileges.</p>

					<p>Nike is a giant. If it is allowed to keep this decision, it will encourage other companies to do the same.
					 Supporting or licensing Nike at this time is to all but endorse labor rights violations.</p>

					<p>Which leaves us with Under Armour.</p>

					<p>I could not find a single article detailing labor rights abuses at factories for Under Armour.</p>

					<p>However, that doesn’t mean Under Armour has no violations. It is a younger company and may possibly
					 not be subject to the same scrutiny. And, more importantly, many companies produce through the same
					  factories or regions.</p>

					<p>“Because most brands rely on a globalized model of manufacturing, the odds are that one [brand’s production]
					 isn’t better than the other,” said Morgan Currier, a national organizer for USAS.</p>

					<p>Universities are fighting against the shared and far-reaching power of sports apparel companies. 
						And while UCLA holds itself to higher standards, it is difficult to coerce companies to do the same.</p>

					<p>“The problem is within the entire market for, say, Adidas, the college market is small. And within the
					 college market, the UCLA market is even smaller,” said Patrick Healey, the ASUCLA director of apparel
					  and accessories. “We prefer to maintain our relationships with these companies so that we can still
					   work on these issues.”</p>

					<p>Healey also said that there is movement toward better accountability though the process is moving slowly.
					 And this process goes back to a question of balance. The ultimate goal is to hold apparel companies to better
					  standards, but this goal comes with a trade-off. Sometimes it is better to cut ties with a company. Other
					   times it is more worthwhile to continue a loyal relationship and build incremental change. And this
					    trade-off is a balance of ethical, professional, economic and political interests.</p>

					<p>Alone, the most UCLA can do is push for better accountability from companies at a glacial pace. 
						It will take united momentum from student campaigns, economic alternatives and multiple universities
						 – no small feats in themselves. But this begins with smaller efforts from UCLA Athletics. It is not
						  enough for one party to care – we have to care together.</p>

					<p>But even if they care, UCLA Athletics must be more transparent in their calculation of interests. When asked
					 about future licenses, they released this statement:</p> <p class="quote">“UCLA Athletics is currently in a long-term, multi-sport
					  shoe and apparel contract with Adidas, and discussing industry competitors would be inappropriate.”</p> <p> Without
					   transparency, we cannot know the degree to which ethical interests and standards are represented.</p>

					<p>As for the immediate future of the sports contract, Under Armour is our best bet for a more ethical licensee.
					 While the company probably has labor issues, it does not have the history of abuse or negligence like Nike or
					  Adidas. They may even be more amenable to improvement.</p>

					<p>Do not dare do business with Nike at this time. If UCLA licenses the company, then we are all but endorsing
					 labor rights violations. If we must do business, then Nike must allow the WRC access to Nike’s suppliers.</p>

					<p>If there are no other options then, for now, license Adidas. But do so with the understanding that the
					 company must work to fit UCLA’s commitment to higher standards of accountability.</p>

					<p>It is never easy, but UCLA must continue to uphold its standards, values and code of conduct. And while UCLA 
						is trying diligently, we cannot let these issues fade into a monotonous background. We have to revisit the
						 history of these issues again year after year to assess what has changed. If we teach accountability,
						  we must practice it too. And that responsibility only grows with this school.</p>
